# AI/ML Tasks

This repository contains my AI/ML completed internship tasks.

## Completed Tasks:

### Task 1: Exploring the Iris Dataset
- Explored the Iris dataset using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Created scatter plots, histograms, and box plots
- Described data using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`

### Task 2: Predicting Next Day’s Stock Price
- Used Tesla stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Applied Linear Regression and Random Forest models
- Evaluated with R² Score and RMSE
- Visualized actual vs predicted closing prices

### Task 3: Multimodal Learning (Image + Text)
- Combined image embeddings (ResNet50) with text embeddings (BERT)
- Trained a simple classifier on concatenated features
- Demonstrated predictions on small image–caption dataset
- Showed potential applications in image–text classification

### Task 4: Health Chatbot using GPT-3.5
- Built a chatbot using OpenAI GPT-3.5 API
- Prompt engineered for safe and friendly health responses
- Added optional safety filters to avoid harmful advice
- Tested with real questions like "What causes a sore throat?"

### Task 5: LLM Application – Document Summarizer
- Implemented a summarizer using Hugging Face Transformers
- Allowed users to input/upload text for automatic summarization
- Provided extractive and abstractive summaries
- Built a demo app using Streamlit/Gradio

## Notes
These notebooks were built in Jupyter using Python libraries.
